title: the one where i continue blogging
---

In 2009 I started to blog, I wrote a post and then I never wrote again. I have always thought that I am not worthy of writing stuff down unless I come up with something groundbreaking. So my post sat around for a few years collecting dust and I never got back into it.

Recently I've been stuffing my brain with information and I think I might soon explode. So I decided to start blogging again. Mostly because I want to improve my written communication and partially because I want to laugh at myself.

Since nobody reads this stuff anyway, my posts will be directed toward me, myself and I. 

We'll see how it goes (I guess I am talking to myself here?)

*clearly off to a good start.
